# Bouteloua Assembly and Annotation

This repository contains code and scripts developed by **Mathavan A Ganesan** for the paper:  

**High-Quality Draft Genome Assemblies and Comparative Genomics of Three *Bouteloua* Species (Poaceae: Chloridoideae)**  

It includes workflows for genome assembly (hifiasm), assembly evaluation (seqkit, BUSCO), gene prediction (Helixer, gffread), and transposable element annotation (EDTA/panEDTA).
